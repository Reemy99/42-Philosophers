# Philosophers
Summary: In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process. You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes.

# Description
1- Five philosophers are sitting at a rounded dining table.

2- There is one chopstick between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

3- Philosophers are either thinking or eating.

4- Whenever a philosopher wishes to eat, she first needs to find two chopsticks.

5- If the hungry philosopher does not have two chopsticks (i.e. one or two of her neighbors already picked up the chopstick) she will have to wait until both chopsticks are available.

6- When a philosopher finishes eating, she puts down both chopsticks to their original places, and resumes thinking.

7- There is an infinite amount of food on their plate, so they only need to worry about the chopsticks.

# There are a few conditions:
1.Philosophers are either thinking or eating. They do not talk to each other.

2.Philosophers can only fetch chopsticks placed between them and their neighbors.

3.Philosophers cannot take their neighborsâ€™ chopsticks away while they are eating.

4.Hopefully no philosophers should starve to death (i.e. wait over a certain amount of time before she acquires both chopsticks).


| function        | Description
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| gettimeofday    | is a function for obtaining the current time. It is defined in the header file sys/time.h and provides the time with microsecond resolution.|
| pthread_join   |  function allows a calling thread to block and wait for the termination of another thread|
|pthread_create  | function creates a new thread and starts its execution|
|pthread_detach| function allows a thread to exit without the need for another thread to call pthread_join to clean up its resources. When a thread is detached, its resources are automatically released when it terminates.|
|pthread_mutex_init| used to initialize a mutex|
|pthread_mutex_lock| used to lock the mutex and gain exclusive access to the shared data|
|pthread_mutex_unlock| used to unlock the mutex and release the shared data|
|pthread_mutex_destroy| s used to clean up the mutex when it is no longer needed|
