# Philosophers
Summary: In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process. You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes.

# Description
1- Five philosophers are sitting at a rounded dining table.

2- There is one chopstick between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

3- Philosophers are either thinking or eating.

4- Whenever a philosopher wishes to eat, she first needs to find two chopsticks.

5- If the hungry philosopher does not have two chopsticks (i.e. one or two of her neighbors already picked up the chopstick) she will have to wait until both chopsticks are available.

6- When a philosopher finishes eating, she puts down both chopsticks to their original places, and resumes thinking.

7- There is an infinite amount of food on their plate, so they only need to worry about the chopsticks.

# There are a few conditions:
1.Philosophers are either thinking or eating. They do not talk to each other.

2.Philosophers can only fetch chopsticks placed between them and their neighbors.

3.Philosophers cannot take their neighborsâ€™ chopsticks away while they are eating.

4.Hopefully no philosophers should starve to death (i.e. wait over a certain amount of time before she acquires both chopsticks).


| function        | Description
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| gettimeofday    | is a function for obtaining the current time. It is defined in the header file sys/time.h and provides the time with microsecond resolution.
|                 |                                                                                                                             |
| pthread_join.   |  function allows a calling thread to block and wait for the termination of another thread                                   |

# pthread_mutex_lock
locks the given mutex. If the mutex is currently unlocked, it becomes locked and owned by the calling thread, and pthread_mutex_lock returns immediately. If the mutex is already locked by another thread, pthread_mutex_lock suspends the calling thread until the mutex is unlocked.
